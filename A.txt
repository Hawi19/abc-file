Wild animals are the undomesticated creatures that roam freely in their natural habitats, independent of human control or intervention. These diverse species, ranging from majestic mammals like lions and elephants to cunning reptiles like snakes and crocodiles, play vital roles in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems across the globe. While captivating to observe, wild animals face ever-increasing threats to their survival, such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.
